# Dashboards and Visualizations
I am fascinated by the stories that data can tell.   While gaining hands-on expertise in Data Science at General Assembly, I have discovered the fascinating world of Data Visualization.  This field merges my two passions: data and design. This is a repository for dashboards that I created with Tableau.  You can see all my dashboards [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alessandro3071) or select from the list below.
* [Street Trees of New York:](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alessandro3071/viz/StreetTreesofNYC-2015Census/StreettreesofNY-2015Census)   Having worked for so many years as a Landscape designer in New York, I wanted to create a dashboard that describes the status of our Urban Forest.
* [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census:](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alessandro3071/viz/CentralParkSquirrelCensus2018_16599962922620/Dashboard#2) The Squirrel Census (https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/) is a multimedia science, design, and storytelling project focusing on the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis). They count squirrels and present their findings to the public.Â Data was collected in the fall of 2018 with the help of 323 volunteer squirrel sighters, as well as The Explorers Club, NYU Department of Environmental Studies, Macaulay Honors College, the Central Park Conservancy, and New York City Department of Parks & Recreation.
